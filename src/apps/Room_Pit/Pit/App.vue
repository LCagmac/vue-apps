	<div class="squareoff">Measuring the amount of presence or the sense of being there, is one of the few ways to assess the quality of a virtual space. This virtual pit experiment is a space that measures the presence by measuring changes in physiological reactions in users such as changes in heart rate. In this virtual room, feel whether your heart is beating faster or your hands get sweaty as if you are in a real space.
