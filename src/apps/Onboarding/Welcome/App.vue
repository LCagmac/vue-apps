	<div class="squareoff"> This digital book is a complement to the printed book Reality Media: Augmented and Virtual Reality published by MIT Press. The digital version takes two forms: a website and a 3D immersive book, which allows you to get inside AR and VR, to inhabit these two new reality media. You are now standing in the entry hall to the immersive book. This hall provides information on how to “read” the immersive book: that is, how to navigate through its galleries and explore the exhibits presented. When you are ready, you can walk through the portal at the far end of this hall to the rotunda, from which you can visit all the galleries. </div>
