	  <div class="squareoff">Minecraft VR is a fully immersive, 
      headset version of the sandbox game that already runs on computers, game consoles, and mobile devices. 
      It is called a "sandbox game" because it provides an independent environment in which 
      players can make their own structures and objects out of virtual, LEGO-like blocks.
