  	   <div class="squareoff">The Pit experiments were conducted by researchers at the University of North Carolina in the early 2000s, to establish empirical evidence of presence in virtual reality. The subjects were asked to perform simple tasks that involved walking to the edge of a virtual pit. Researchers measured their physiological reactions to see if they experienced signs of fear, such as an accelerated heart beat. Pass through the portal to experience the Pit Room yourself.</div>
